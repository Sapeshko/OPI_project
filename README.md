touch typing trainer

The Blind Typing Trainer is a program designed to help users improve their touch typing skills without looking at the keyboard. The program presents a string of words and spaces on the screen, with both English and Russian words included. The dictionary of possible words is generated programmatically.

The user is prompted to input a string by typing on the keyboard, attempting to reproduce the original string. The program analyzes the input string and replaces correctly inputted words with new words from the dictionary. Incorrectly inputted words are left unchanged, with any incorrectly entered letters doubled. If the entire string is correctly entered, its length is reduced by two characters.
